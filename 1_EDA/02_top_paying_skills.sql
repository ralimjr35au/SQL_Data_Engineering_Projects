/*
    Question: What are the highest paying skills for data engineers?
        * Calculate the median salary for each skill required in data engineer positions
        * Focus on remote positions with specified salaries
        * Include skill frequency to identify both salary and demand
        Why?
            * Helps identify which skills command the highest compensation while also
            showing how common those skills are, providing a more complete picture for skill development priorities
            * The median is used instead of the average to reduce the impact of outlier salaries
